Loading PGN File: The code loads a PGN file (std_train_big.clean.pgn) containing a collection of chess games for analysis.

Tracking ELO Ratings: It extracts the ELO ratings of the white and black players from the headers of each game in the PGN file.
It stores these ratings in two lists: white_elos and black_elos.

Game Evaluation (Advantage Calculation): It computes the "advantage" (in centipawns) between the white and black players during each move in a single game.
It uses a utility function (chess_utils.get_board_position_value()) to evaluate the board position at each move for both players, 
storing the difference (white's advantage minus black's advantage) in two lists: advw (white advantage) and advb (black advantage).

Data Visualization:
ELO Distribution: It creates two separate plots using seaborn's displot to show the frequency distribution of ELO ratings for the white and black players.
Advantage Graph: It generates a plot showing how the advantage (in centipawns) shifts over time during the moves of a single game, 
illustrating the ebb and flow of advantage between the two players.
